ThaiFonts-Siampradesh
=====================

This project is an attempt to adjust fonts from DIP & SIPA contested fonts [1]
for use in GNU/Linux desktops. All fonts are renamed as required by the license.

The difference from original fonts includes:

  * Ready for editing with Fontforge, with all traps cleared
  * Scaled up to match western fonts at the same point size
  * Cleaner splines (for some fonts) and more reference usage
    (i.e. smaller file size)
  * Miscellaneous bug fixes
