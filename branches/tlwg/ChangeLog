	* First created the fontforge project from TTF files:
	  - Relicense to GPL with font exception, as agreed by DIP & SIPA.
	  - Ensure that common fields in TTF Names are extracted from
	    Postscript Names, for consistency.
	  - Set Manufacturer (Foundry) to IPTH, retaining previous info in
	    Designer field. Also update UniqueID accordingly.
